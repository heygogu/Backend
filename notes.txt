we temporarily store images on server , in case of the connection loss.
So that we have them safe,
and then we can upload them on cloudnary using third process.. entirely depends on the company.

Note:- Git doesn't track empty folder (remember it).
To track them we can use a file named .gitkeep (just a convention)

.env file - this file have environment variables from systems.. add them to gitignore

Make a new folder src and create files
  ->app.js 
  ->constants.js 
  ->index.js 

We need to create some folders in src too- but let's save that for later or we would require .gitkeep

Let's write some scripts 
=> "type":"module" inside package.json

we need to start or stop the server frequently , we can use --watch in nodejs or people fav "nodemon"
install nodemon (when file is saved server restarts), save it as dev Dependency

Dev Dependency => used during development, not in production

"npm i -d nodemon" in your terminal => it creates node_modules folder and dev dependencies in package.json

now ask nodemon to track index.js using a script

=> "dev":"nodemon src/index.js"

There is a conflict between type-module and env variables .. we need to resolve it
as we need to use require syntax for importing 'dotenv' package.
